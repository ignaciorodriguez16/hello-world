After 4 years with Ajax, he transferred to Juventus FC and led them to 2 championships, but the team was stripped away from the titles because of club management scandals. This forced Zlatan to transfer to Inter Milan. There he won 3 titles and a league scoring crown in 2009. in 2009 he was traded to Fc Barcelona and won another title, but later was traded to AC Milan. There he won his second scoring crown but he didn't win a title so it ended his 8 season straight title win streak. In 2012 he transferred to Paris Saint-Germain, there he won his third scoring title and led the team to its first title in 19 years.
